                        ALPSO LICENSE

This is a license for the Augmented Lagrangian Particle Swarm 
Optimizer (ALPSO). The license for ALPSO is based on the 
Simple Public License (SimPL). In the same spirit as the SimPL,
the ALPSO License is a plain language implementation of GPL 2.0.
The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee
for all users the freedom to share and change software. If anyone
wonders about the meaning of the ALPSO License, they should 
interpret it as consistent with GPL 2.0. By downloading, using, 
modifying, or distributing ALPSO, you are agreeing to all of the 
terms described in this license agreement. Your agreement with 
this license gives you extremely generous rights, so if you do 
not agree to the terms of this agreement, you may not proceed 
further with using, modifying, or distributing ALPSO.

The ALPSO License applies to the software's source and object code 
and comes with any rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). 
You agree to the ALPSO License simply by downloading, copying, 
distributing, or making a derivative work of the software.

You get the royalty free right to:

  - Use the software for any non-commercial purpose;
  - Make derivative works of it (this is called a "Derived Work");
  - Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work, provided that the 
    Derived work is also for non-commercial purposes 

If you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back 
to the community by:

  - Prominently noting the date of any changes you make;
  - Leaving other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, 
    and license terms in place;
  - Providing the source code, build scripts, installation scripts, 
    and interface definitions in a form that is easy to get and best 
    to modify;
  - Licensing it to everyone under the terms of this license, without 
    adding further restrictions to the rights provided;
  - Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that license;
  - Promising that you will not make a profit of any kind from the 
    distribution or re-distribution of the software. 

ALPSO is a completely free software for academic, not-for-profit, or 
government use. Commercial use of ALPSO is strictly prohibited without
permission. Permission may be obtained for a commercial organization 
to use ALPSO by contacting Dr. Ruben E. Perez at Ruben.Perez@rmc.ca. 
Potential commercial users of ALPSO are, however, permitted to 
download the software for evaluation purposes for a period of 90 
(ninety) days. After the 90-day evaluation period, a commercial user 
must either terminate use of ALPSO or purchase a commercial license. 
Under no circumstances may anyone except the copyright holders of 
ALPSO profit from the use or distribution of ALPSO.

There are some things that you must shoulder:

  - THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES 
    OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND 
    NONINFRINGEMENT;
  - IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR 
    ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF 
    CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
    WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

The ALPSO License continues perpetually, except that your license 
rights end automatically if:

  - You do not abide by the "give back to the community" terms (your 
    licensees get to keep their rights if they abide);
  - Anyone prevents you from distributing the software under the 
    terms of of this license agreement;
  - You use any portion of the software for commercial purposes or 
    sell any portion of the software (and, of course, are not one of
    the copyright holders). 

In addition, to the license given above, the following is a condition 
of using or modifying the ALPSO software in any manner:

  - Any results presented using ALPSO (i.e., conference papers, 
    journal papers, oral presentations, or any other media) should 
    include explicit citation to the fact that ALPSO was used to 
    generate the results. In particular, it is mandatory to cite the 
    following reference in any such media where results using ALPSO 
    are presented:
